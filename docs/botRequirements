Raspberry Pi 2 Model B

would like a report on the poster ideally to help us find 
the top posters: 
User A 
Posts: 1,000 posts 
Followers: 14.3k followers 
last 3 posts likes: 
1 days ago: 1,380 likes 
2 days ago: 2,320 likes 
4 days ago: 2,101 likes 

2) once we have a report we will manually 
message posters to share our posts but yes 
I would like a bot to comment, like, follow, 
unfollow all posts.

Hereâ€™s how: 
1) Find hashtag 
2) Search through results (1000 or so) 
3) select url hyperlink. 
- scrape followers 
- scrape likes

import lzma
import os
import json

for file in os.listdir(os.getcwd()):
    print(file)
	f = lzma.open(file, mode='rt', encoding='utf-8').read()
	js = json.loads(f)

["node"]["owner"]



instaloader "#sourdough" --post-filter="likes>100" --no-captions --no-pictures

# Get info from profile - must be logged in.
p = Profile.from_username(L.context, p.owner_username)
for x in p.get_followers():
	print(x)

from pathlib import Path
p = Path('.')
pp = Path('afirdworld')
f = lzma.open(pp / "2019-04-04_04-50-32_UTC.json.xz", mode='rt', encoding='utf-8').read()
