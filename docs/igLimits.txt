Instagram Limits and Strategies

Following Instagram follow limits and how to moderate
your activities in order to avoid getting blocked
from performing certain activities (following, liking,
commenting and DM-ing).

How many people can you follow?
There are no universal follow limits for instagram.
A few important factors come into play:
* Age of Instagram acccount
* Size - Number of followers
* Overall engagement (commenting, liking)
* Active / Inactive accounts
* Quality of proxies

Aged instagram accounts (~3months +) are able to
follow more people on Instagram than new accounts.
Accounts with a lot of followers can follow more than 
those with a few followers. Active accounts that also 
have great engagement also tend to be allowed to 
follow more than dormant accounts.

How many people can you follow per day?
New instagram accounts, 50 - 80 the first day.
Increase the number by 10-20 every new day
until reaching a maximum of 500/day for that account.
This is the process of safely warming up new Instagram
accounts.

Assuming you're manually following people
on Instagram, by the time your new instagram
account is fully warmed up, you'll be following
32 people per hour, or following a user every 2
minutes. You could go up to 40 per hour.

How many people can you unfollow per day?
The real question, is when do you unfollow?
It's best to way at least 3 days before unfollowing
someone. This gives them enough time to see the
notification.

How many posts can you like per day?
You can safely like per day up to 1.5x the amount
of follows you do. 
Say your follow limit is 400/day, that allows up to 
600 likes per day.

Set the bot to like 1-3 posts of a user immediately 
after following them. This helps increase the 
follow-back rate.

Comment Limits
A maximum of 250/day should be safe.
