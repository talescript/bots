that was once suggested and no one (except me) reacted to it
I guess everyone found their limits and is happy with them

What I would try: 
start with 50 follows and 100 likes per day 
then every day add 20 follows and 50 likes 
after one month you should be at 500 follows a day and at like 1600 likes a day These are pretty safe 
numbers I guess 
unfollow after 4-5 days (I'd to about 200 unfollows for the first 2 weeks then 
increase to 400 then after a month do 500 unfollows to keep a steady follower count )


Identify accounts that are bots and block them from following


it would be cool to follow users / like  posts of users who have a high following to follower ratio. 
they are more likely to follow you
then scan they're followers for the same
like a couple of they're pics etc
unfollow a couple of days later (if your that way inclined)
or even just use that function just to like the posts

also is it possible to make a list of people who you followed then unfollowed. 
just so you dont keep following them
also the accounts shouldnt be random, they must have common hashtags
so you would find the users via a hashtag
and then let it run from there etc

also you need to distinguish who your actualy friends are on there
just so you dont end up unfollollowing people you actually know
possibly creating a list of all people followerd / liked using the script.
so that the people you actually follow using the normal app , it dosnt record them
also what would be cool is to be able to do this with multiple accounts at once,
